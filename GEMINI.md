# Unreal Engine MCP Server

## Project Overview

The **Unreal Engine MCP Server** (`unreal-engine-mcp-server`) is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to control Unreal Engine via a native automation bridge. It facilitates bidirectional communication between an AI agent (running via MCP) and an active Unreal Engine Editor session.

### Architecture

The system is composed of three main components:

1. **MCP Server (Node.js/TypeScript):**
    * **Role:** The core server that implements the MCP protocol, handles client requests, and orchestrates communication.
    * **Location:** `src/`
    * **Key File:** `src/index.ts` (Entry point), `src/unreal-bridge.ts` (Connection management).
    * **Tools:** Defines MCP tools for Actor manipulation, Asset management, Blueprints, etc. (found in `src/tools/`).

2. **Unreal Engine Plugin (C++):**
    * **Role:** Acts as the receiver and executor within the Unreal Engine process. It runs a WebSocket server to listen for commands from the Node.js server.
    * **Location:** `Plugins/McpAutomationBridge/`
    * **Key Functionality:** Handles `execute_console_command`, `set_object_property`, and other engine-level operations on the Game Thread.
    * **Communication:** Listens on `ws://localhost:8091` (default).

3. **WebAssembly Module (Rust):**
    * **Role:** Provides high-performance utilities for the Node.js server, such as complex property parsing and vector math.
    * **Location:** `wasm/`
    * **Key File:** `wasm/src/lib.rs`.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* Unreal Engine (5.0-5.7)
* Rust (optional, if modifying WASM components)

### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. **Build the Server:**

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

3. **Build WebAssembly (Optional):**
    If you are working on the Rust module:

    ```bash
    bun run build:wasm
    ```

4. **Unreal Plugin Installation:**
    * Copy the `Plugins/McpAutomationBridge` folder into your Unreal Project's `Plugins` directory (e.g., `YourProject/Plugins/`).
    * Regenerate project files and recompile your Unreal project.
    * Enable the plugin in the Unreal Editor if it's not automatically enabled.
    * Ensure the plugin is running (it should log "MCP Automation Bridge listening" to the Output Log).

### Running the Server

To start the MCP server:

```bash
bun start
```

Or for development with `ts-node`:

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Testing

The project includes a suite of integration tests located in the `tests/` directory. These scripts act as "fake" MCP clients to verify functionality.

* **Run All Tests:**

    ```bash
    bun test
    ```

* **Run Specific Test:**

    ```bash
    bun run test:control_actor
    bun run test:manage_asset
    bun run test:wasm
    ```

## Development Conventions

* **Language:**
  * Server logic is written in **TypeScript**.
  * Unreal integration is written in **C++**.
  * Performance modules are written in **Rust**.
* **Safety:**
  * The `UnrealBridge` class (`src/unreal-bridge.ts`) includes safety mechanisms like command throttling and "Safe ViewMode" switching to prevent crashing the engine with invalid commands.
  * **Do not** bypass these safety checks when adding new functionality.
* **Linting:**
  * TypeScript: `bun run lint`
  * C++/C#: Scripts provided (`bun run lint:cpp`, `bun run lint:csharp`) rely on external tools like `cpplint` and `dotnet-format`.

## Directory Structure

* `src/`: Source code for the Node.js MCP server.
  * `tools/`: Definitions for MCP tools (Actors, Assets, etc.).
  * `resources/`: Definitions for MCP resources.
  * `wasm/`: Compiled WebAssembly bindings.
* `Plugins/`: Source code for the Unreal Engine C++ plugin.
* `wasm/`: Source code for the Rust WebAssembly module.
* `tests/`: Integration tests and test runners.
* `scripts/`: Utility scripts for build and maintenance.

# Project Rules Agent

* The user explicitly wants real, working code only. I must never add mocks, placeholders, false-passed success code, or any non-functional code. All solutions should be directly applicable to a live editor and pass all relevant tests genuinely.

* Before editing codes in plugin make sure to check before in engine's code so that all code are correct.
